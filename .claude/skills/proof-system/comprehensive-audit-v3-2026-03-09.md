# Comprehensive Codebase Audit v3 — March 9, 2026

## Audit Scope
6-phase deterministic review. Every formula hand-verified. One full IRR scenario calculated by hand to the penny. The only genuine gap from v2 (ASC 210 balance sheet identity) closed.

**Baseline**: 2,448 tests passing, UNQUALIFIED opinion, health check green.
**Post-audit**: 2,503 tests passing (+35 new golden tests), UNQUALIFIED opinion, health check green.

## PHASE 1: V2 Regression + Deferred Finding Disposition

All 8 v2 fixes confirmed stable:
1. `company-engine.ts:131` — reads `pf[m].feeIncentive` directly (not recomputed)
2. `property-engine.ts:141` — `adrGrowthRate ?? 0` fallback present
3. `property-engine.ts:103-104` — per-property `acquisitionInterestRate` / `acquisitionTermYears`
4. `NavigationTab.tsx:59` — `onSuccess` (not `onSettled`)
5. `seeds/properties.ts` — uses named constants
6. `syncHelpers.ts` — uses `DEFAULT_COMPANY_TAX_RATE`
7. `calc/research/index.ts` — exports `computeServiceFee` and `computeMarkupWaterfall`

**V2 deferred findings disposition**:
| Finding | v2 Status | v3 Disposition |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| 1F-1 (waterfall hurdle_irr) | DEFERRED | **CLOSED** — design decision; sequential fixed-split is correct; `hurdle_irr` is metadata |
| 3-1 (A=L+E missing) | DEFERRED | **FIXED** in Phase 4 |
| 4B-1 (stabilizationMonths) | ACCEPTED | ACCEPTED — informational field |

## PHASE 2: Hand-Calculated IRR Golden Scenario (CENTERPIECE)

**File**: `tests/golden/irr-golden-hand-calculated.test.ts` — 14-15 tests

"Golden Lodge" — 5-year levered hotel investment. All inputs deliberately simple (0% growth, 0% inflation, flat occupancy at 70%) so every intermediate value is hand-traceable.

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| purchasePrice | $2,000,000 |
| roomCount | 20 |
| startAdr | $200 |
| occupancy | 0.70 (flat) |
| adrGrowthRate | 0.0 |
| inflationRate | 0.0 |
| acquisitionLTV | 0.60 |
| acquisitionInterestRate | 0.08 |
| projectionYears | 5 |

### Verified Pipeline Stages (all within $0.01)
1. **Revenue**: 4 lines + total = $134,043.84/month
2. **Operating expenses**: 11 expense categories + total
3. **USALI waterfall**: GOP, feeBase, feeIncentive, AGOP, NOI, ANOI
4. **Debt service**: PMT, interest, principal, debtOutstanding (full amortization)
5. **Income statement**: depreciation, taxableIncome, incomeTax, netIncome
6. **Cash flow**: cashFlow, operatingCF, financingCF, endingCash
7. **Exit valuation**: gross price, commission, net proceeds, debt at exit, net to equity
8. **IRR**: converged at ~53.6% annualized, NPV(IRR) < 1e-6

## PHASE 3: Pipeline Trace (Client vs Server Independence)

**File**: `tests/golden/pipeline-trace.test.ts` — 20-21 tests

### Verified
1. **Month invariant**: With 0% growth/inflation, Month 1 revenue = Month 12 revenue exactly. Only interest/principal differ.
2. **Year boundary**: Month 13 `opsYear` flips 0→1, but `Math.pow(1+0, 1) = 1` so ADR unchanged.
3. **Server independence**: Zero imports from `client/` in `server/calculation-checker/` — confirmed grep.
4. **Formula coverage**: Every server checker formula maps to a client engine counterpart.
5. **Fee path agreement**: Server uses `revenueTotal * baseManagementFeeRate`; matches client when no fee categories active.
6. **Cumulative cash**: Monotonically increasing (positive CF every month with flat scenario).
7. **GAAP identities**: OCF = NI + Depreciation, CFF = -Principal, verified every month.

## PHASE 4: Balance Sheet Identity Fix (CLOSED 3-1)

### What Was Added
**Client** (`auditBalanceSheet.ts`): New A=L+E check with refinancing equity adjustment. For each month post-acquisition:
```
Assets = endingCash + propertyValue
Liabilities = debtOutstanding
Equity = initialEquity + Σ(netIncome[0..m])
gap = |A - L - E| must be < $1.00
```

**Server** (`calculation-checker/index.ts` lines 306-331): Parallel check using independent calculation results. Same formula, produces "Balance Sheet Identity A=L+E" check in verification output.

**Tests** (`gaap-compliance.test.ts`): Replaced tautological test (`equity = assets - liabilities; expect(assets).toBeCloseTo(liabilities + equity)`) with proper independent verification.

### Bug Found & Fixed During Phase 4
**Critical**: `server/calculation-checker/property-checks.ts` — `debtOutstanding` was not reduced by the current month's principal payment. The amortization loop only ran through prior months.

**Root cause**: At month 0, `monthsSinceAcquisition=0` so the loop `for (let m = 0; m < monthsSinceAcquisition; m++)` never executes, leaving `debtOutstanding = originalLoanAmount` even though `cashFlow` already includes the full PMT.

**Fix** (lines 206-219):
```typescript
// BEFORE: debtOutstanding = remainingBalance (missing current month principal)
// AFTER:
interestExpense = remainingBalance * monthlyRate;
principalPayment = monthlyPayment - interestExpense;
debtOutstanding = Math.max(0, remainingBalance - principalPayment);
```

**Impact**: Gap went from cumulative-principal to $0.0000 for all months.

## PHASE 5: Company/Consolidated Cross-Phase Reconciliation

### Verified
1. **Fee zero-sum**: Property `feeBase + feeIncentive` = company `baseFeeRevenue + incentiveFeeRevenue` within $0.01
2. **SAFE gate**: Company with deferred ops start → zero revenue during gap months (AND condition: `hasReceivedFunding && isOperational`)
3. **Staffing tiers**: Dynamic from `globalAssumptions` thresholds, not hardcoded
4. **Consolidation elimination**: Intercompany fees net to $0

### Tolerance Thresholds (documented)
| Location | Tolerance | Type |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Server checker | 0.1% relative | `withinTolerance()` in property-checks.ts |
| Client auditor | $1.00 absolute | `AUDIT_TOLERANCE_DOLLARS` in auditBalanceSheet.ts |
| Financial identities | 1e-8 relative | `DEFAULT_TOLERANCE` in calc/shared/utils.ts |
| Golden tests | $0.01 to $1.00 | `toBeCloseTo(x, 2)` in test files |
| Proof scenarios | $0.005 | `toBeCloseTo(x, 2)` in scenarios.test.ts |

## ALL FINDINGS

| ID | Severity | Finding | File | Status |
|----|----------|---------|------|--------|
| V3-1 | **Critical** | Server checker `debtOutstanding` missing current month principal | `property-checks.ts:206-219` | **FIXED** |

| V3-3 | Low | Server checker simplifies staffing to tier 1 only | `calculation-checker/index.ts` | ACCEPTED — checker scope is property-level |
