        The financial model enforces mandatory business rules that reflect real-world constraints.
        These rules cannot be overridden — if any are violated, the system flags the scenario as invalid.
      </p>

      <Callout severity="critical" variant="light" title="1. Management Company Funding Gate">
        <p>
          Operations of the Management Company cannot begin before funding is received. The company requires
          capital tranches to cover startup costs before management fee revenue begins flowing from properties.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout severity="critical" variant="light" title="2. Property Activation Gate">
        <p>
          A property cannot begin operating before it is purchased and funding is in place. Revenue and operating
          expenses only begin after the acquisition date and operations start date.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout severity="critical" variant="light" title="3. No Negative Cash Rule">
        <p>
          Cash balances for each property, the Management Company, and the aggregated portfolio must never be negative.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout severity="critical" variant="light" title="4. Debt-Free at Exit">
        <p>
          At exit, all properties must be debt-free. Outstanding loan balances are repaid from gross sale proceeds
          before calculating net proceeds to equity.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-muted rounded p-2 font-mono text-xs mt-2">
          <div>Gross Sale Value = Final Year NOI / Exit Cap Rate</div>

          <div>= Net Proceeds to Equity</div>
        </div>

      <Callout severity="critical" variant="light" title="5. No Over-Distribution Rule">
        <p>
          FCF distributions and refinancing proceeds returned to investors must not exceed available cash.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout severity="critical" variant="light" title="6. Income Statement: Interest Only (No Principal)">
        <p>
          The income statement shows <strong>only interest expense</strong>, never principal repayment.
          Principal payments are balance sheet transactions that reduce the loan liability.
        </p>
      </Callout>

      <Callout severity="critical" variant="light" title="7. Capital Structure Presentation">
        <p>
          All financial reports must present capital sources on separate lines for clarity:
