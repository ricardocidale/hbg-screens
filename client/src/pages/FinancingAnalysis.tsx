Enter your property's NOI and loan terms to see how much you can borrow.",

This tool calculates your debt yield and determines the maximum loan based on that threshold, then compares it against the LTV constraint to find the binding limit.",

Understanding prepayment costs is critical for refinancing or sale decisions.",
